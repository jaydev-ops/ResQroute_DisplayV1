# resQroute — Technical Architecture & Engineering Blueprint

> **SIH Problem Statement SIH26191**: Intelligent Identification of Hazard-Based Red Zones, Carrying Capacity Assessment, and Immediate Relocation Needs for Vulnerable Habitations

`resQroute` is a **Web-First**, real-time disaster-response, relocation, and shelter-intelligence platform built on the foundational thesis:

**SHORTEST ROUTE ≠ SAFEST ROUTE**

During natural disasters (floods, landslides, storm surges), a shelter may technically exist and have open space, but citizens may be unable to reach or use it because road segments are submerged, bridges are compromised, or physical route attributes violate accessibility requirements. `resQroute` replaces conventional shortest-path routing with **Risk-Aware, Accessibility-Aware, and Capacity-Aware Relocation Recommendations**.

## 1. Primary Core Principles

1. **Shortest Route ≠ Safest Route**: Safety constraints, water level overlays, and hard road closures strictly override simple distance optimization.
2. **AI Assists — Validated Data & Deterministic Routing Decide**: Machine learning models (NLP classifiers, computer vision) act exclusively as shadow proposal generators. They **never** mutate graph edge states directly without policy verification or authority approval.
3. **SMS Provides a Fallback Communication Channel — resQroute Provides the Intelligence**: SMS enables compact text payload exchange over degraded 2G networks when web data drops.
4. **Append-Only Shelter Capacity**: Occupancy updates are processed as immutable, source-stamped event streams with optimistic locking and materialized availability views displaying `"Reported at [timestamp]"`.

## 4. Behavioral Safety Assertions

- **Assertion 1**: Confirmed closed road edges (`is_closed = TRUE`) **MUST NEVER** appear in returned relocation routes.
- **Assertion 2**: Shelters with 100% occupancy or active hazard warnings **MUST NEVER** be recommended to citizens.
- **Assertion 3**: Stale graph overlay states (> 30 minutes without refresh) **MUST** trigger an explicit UI warning banner: `"WARNING: Routing data stale by X minutes."`
- **Assertion 4**: Raw citizen community reports **CANNOT** declare hard closures without policy-qualified evidence or authority confirmation.
